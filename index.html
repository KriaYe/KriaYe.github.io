Hello, my name is Liu Ye, from China. My hobbies are using music production software to write original music myself, which includes symphony, electronic music, etc. 
On this page, I'll share with you my own independently produced music and my thoughts on music creation

<h2>My composition inspiration</h2>
<p>I love all kinds of different types of music, and since I was a kid listening to all kinds of songs I like, whether it's classical symphony, pop, or electronic music, all of which are my favorite songs.<br/>
As a child, my mother opened my musical path by letting me learn piano. Through the accumulation of exercise, I can gradually write some melodic fragments myself, and now, I can produce songs independently.<br/>
I watched the symphonies of many famous orchestras on the Internet, learned about the instruments required for the symphony and integrated them through my own understanding. For example, in my work Falling Lights to the Sky, I use the following instruments:
